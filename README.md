# Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) in PyTorch

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) using PyTorch. The FNN is trained to perform binary classification tasks.

## Overview

The FNN architecture consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Sigmoid activation functions are applied after each linear transformation. The network is trained using gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error loss.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch

## Usage

To use the FNN, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/fnn-pytorch.git
   cd fnn-pytorch
   ```

3. Run the example script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

The `main.py` script in this repository demonstrates how to create an instance of the FNN, train it on sample data, and evaluate its performance.
